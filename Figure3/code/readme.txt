These matlab code generates the data file in text format to create the heatmaps as shown in figure panel 3.
- Heatmap_vary_h_d.m can generates data for figure 3A and 3C. 
- Heatmap_vary_h_p.m can generates data for figure 3B and 3D.
- Both Heatmap_vary_h_d.m and Heatmap_vary_h_p.m requires fun_drmxr.m to execution.
- The value of the fitness cost in figure 3 A & B is 0 and in figure 3 C & D is 0.1
- Excecuting the code will ask to input the value of the fitness cost.
- Put the appropriate value of 'c' to get desired the data file to generate the heatmap.
