The matlab code 'read_txt_make_img.m' generates heatmaps from the text data file as shown in figure panel 3.
- Heatmap_vary_h_d.m can generates data for figure 3A and 3C. 
- Heatmap_vary_h_p.m can generates data for figure 3B and 3D.


Following text files contains the data for figure 3A, B, C and D:
Figure 3A - heatmap_vary_h_d.txt
Figure 3B - heatmap_vary_h_p.txt
Figure 3C - heatmap_vary_h_d_c_0_1.txt
Figure 3D - heatmap_vary_h_p_c_0_1.txt
