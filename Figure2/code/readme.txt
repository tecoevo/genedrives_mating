This Mathematica notebook plots individual figures of figure panel 2.

It plots the simplex with internal fixed points for varying mate choice bias for the four scenarios:
1) Null case where there is no gene drive
2) Medea drive of 100% efficiency (d = 1)
3) Distorsion based gene drive of 100% efficiency (p = 1)
4) When fertility fitness cost c = 0.2
