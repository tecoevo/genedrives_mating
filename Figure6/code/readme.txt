The given matlab codes simulates the results for figure panel 6. The results are provided in the text file format. 
While simulating results of figure A part-1, value of distortion probability 'p' has to be input by the user. 
Similarly, simulation of results for figure 6A part-2, 6B, and 6C, requires the user to input value of average network degree 'k'.

Code file Fix_prob_vary_freq_DD.m and Fix_prob_vary_freq_WD.m generates results for figure 6A part-2, 6B, and 6C. Fix_prob_vary_k.m generates is for figure 6A part-1.
These codes generates the data files contained in "Figure6/data" folder which in turns are used to produce figures.

The above main simulation file require the following function to run: networkComponents.m, small_world.m and linspecer.m.
