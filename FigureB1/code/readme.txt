% Figure B1: Effect on the rate of production of DD genotype with increases
% in degree of polygamy for different fitness cost. 
% We start from a population consisting of equal abundance of all the three 
% genotypes with 100\% drive efficiency of distortion based gene drive for 
% different fitness cost. Increasing the fitness cost of drive allele decreases 
% the overall production of DD genotype. For moderate level of fitness cost, 
% production of genotype DD first increases upto a point for species with 
% higher level of polygamy but then started to decrease.
